# Hiring-Process-Analytics
This project analyzes the hiring process, identifying trends and patterns using Excel data analytics.

Project Description:
The hiring process is a crucial function of any company, and understanding trends such as the number of rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies can provide valuable insights for the hiring department. My project involves analysing the company's hiring process data to draw meaningful insights and help improve the overall efficiency of the hiring department.
As a data analyst, I will work with a dataset containing records of previous hires. This project aims to analyse this data and answer key questions that can help the company refine its hiring strategies. Through this analysis, I aim to identify trends and patterns that can inform decision-making and enhance the company's recruitment efforts.

Approach:
1. Data Collection and Review:
   - Acquired and reviewed the dataset to understand key columns such as gender, salary, department, and position tier.
2. Data Cleaning:
   - Used Excel functions to identify and handle missing values.
   - Applied statistical measures to detect and treat outliers.
3. Data Transformation:
   - Combined categories in certain columns to simplify analysis.
4. Analysis:
   - Gender Distribution: Used `COUNTIF` functions to determine the gender distribution of hires.
   - Average Salary: Calculated average salary using the `AVERAGE` function.
   - Salary Distribution: Created class intervals to understand salary ranges.
5. Visualization:
   - Used pie charts and bar graphs to visualize department proportions and position tiers.

Tools Used
- Excel Functions: ’IF’, ‘ISBLANK’, ‘COUNTIF’, ‘AVERAGE’
-Charts and Graphs: Pie charts, and bar graphs for data visualization

Tech-Stack Used:
I used Microsoft Excel 2019 to make this project. I also made use of the formulas in the tool.
